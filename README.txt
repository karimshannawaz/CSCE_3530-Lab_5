PLEASE NOTE: when running the program, use "make all" to compile and to run the program,
			 type in on the console: ./mainlab5
			 and use "make clean" to clean up the output files.

								Comments and code usage:								
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I wrote comments throughout my code that were in order, so they would be easy to read
and easy to follow. The program can be viewed beginning at Main.c, where the main execution
function reads in the router.txt file, then stores the costs from the source to destination
routers in a two-dimensional cost matrix. This cost matrix is transferred over to the dijkstra
function, which performs dijkstra's greedy algorithm for finding the shortest path between 
vertices, or in this case, between six different routers: u, v, w, x, y, z. 

After dijkstra's algorithm is executed, the shortest path is generated by printing the nodes
that were in the parent array created while performing the algorithm. This path that is printed
out is also written to the LS.txt file, showing the least cost path between all of the routers.
The program is then finished and satisfies all of the requirements.
